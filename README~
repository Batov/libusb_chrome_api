Brief
--------
 - MSPdebug has been ported from C-code to JS-code (to Chrome extension environment);
 - Emscripten as sourse-to-sourse translation;
 - Libusb platform layer based on Chrome USB API;


 
Libusb 
--------
Folder: 
	libusb/chrome_usb.c - platform layer source;
	libusb/chrome_usb.h - platform layer header (like linux.h for linux environment);

	libusb/usb.h	    - common endpoint of platform-independent libusb part;

	and some of system source and headers...

This is an alpha version of libusb port. There is not standart libusb make algorithm. Just source and headers =)

Libusb 
--------
Source-to-source port linux application (with libusb) to Chrome.

1. Install Emscripten - http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/index.html
2. Edit your application's makefile:
	- remove '-lusb' key;
	- add include path to libusb folder (like '-Ilibusb')
	- rename binary (e.g mspdebug -> mspdebug.html)
3. Edit your application's makefile for emscripten - http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/porting/index.html
